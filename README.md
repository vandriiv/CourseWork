Calculate tangents in a point on a surface using either numerical or numeric partial derivatives.
Calculate a normal vector taking cross product of the two derivatives.
It has to be possible to move the point along the surface (u,v) space using a keyboard. E.g. keys A and D move the point along u parameter and keys W and S move the point along v parameter.
